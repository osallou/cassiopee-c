cassiopee-c
===========

Cassiopee index and search library C implementation.
It is a complete rewrite of the ruby Cassiopee gem.
It scan an input genomic sequence (dna/rna/protein) and search for a
subsequence with exact match or allowing substitutions (Hamming distance)
and/or insertion/deletions.

This program provides both a binary (Cassiopee) and a shared library.

Index is based on a suffix tree with compression. It is possible to save the
indexed sequence for later use without the need to reindex the whole sequence
(for large data sets).

See Cassiopee -h for all options.

Expected input sequence is a one-line sequence with no header. CassiopeeKnife  (see later chapter) can be used to convert Fasta sequences in cassiopee input sequences.
